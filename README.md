# Annasamarpan

</div>


## Description
Annasamarpan is a **food donation platform** that connects **Institutes** (such as colleges, hostels, and restaurants) with **NGOs** to facilitate the **efficient donation and distribution of surplus food** to orphans and people in need. The platform ensures that excess food does not go to waste by enabling real-time food availability listings, streamlined bookings, and easy communication between donors and receivers.

## User Flow
1. **Signup & Login**:
   - NGOs and Institutes have **separate signup processes** but share a **common login system**.
   
2. **Food Listing** (Institutes):
   - Institutes list available food for **Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner**.
   - Food listings are updated **daily**.

3. **Food Browsing & Booking** (NGOs):
   - NGOs view available food listings.
   - NGOs book food items based on availability.

4. **Booking Confirmation & Notifications**:
   - Once an NGO books food, the **Institute receives a notification**.
   - Upon confirmation, **both parties can communicate** to finalize food pickup.

5. **Daily Food Refresh**:
   - Food availability **resets daily** to ensure accurate tracking and fair distribution.
